# 1: Define the functions lock and unlock our app containers setup processes:
function lock_setup { mkdir -p $APP_TEMP_PATH && touch $APP_SETUP_LOCK; }
function unlock_setup { rm -rf $APP_SETUP_LOCK; }
function wait_setup { echo "Waiting for app setup to finish..."; sleep $APP_SETUP_WAIT; }

# 2: 'Unlock' the setup process if the script exits prematurely:
trap unlock_setup HUP INT QUIT KILL TERM EXIT

# 3: Wait until the setup 'lock' file no longer exists:
while [ -f $APP_SETUP_LOCK ]; do wait_setup; done

# 4: 'Lock' the setup process, to prevent a race condition when the project's
# app containers will try to install gems and setup the database concurrently:
lock_setup

# 5: Check if the database exists, or setup the database if it doesn't, as it is
# the case when the project runs for the first time.
#
# We'll use a custom script `check_or_setup_db` (inside our app's `bin` folder),
# instead of running `rake db:version  || rake db:setup`, as running that command
# (at least on rails 4.2.4) will leave a couple of small ruby zombie processes
# running in the container:
bundle exec check_db || rails db:setup

# 6: 'Unlock' the setup process:
unlock_setup

# 7: Specify a default command, in case it wasn't issued:
if [ -z "$1" ]; then set -- rails server -p 3000 -b 0.0.0.0 "$@"; fi

# 8: If the command to execute is 'rails server', then remove any existing pid
# file, which may be still present if a previous rails container was killed off
# suddenly:
if [[ "$1" = "rails" && ("$2" = "s" || "$2" = "server") ]]; then rm -rf /usr/src/app/tmp/pids/server.pid; fi

# 9: Execute the given or default command:
exec "$@"
